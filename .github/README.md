# **Phaser 3 Vite & Express Template**

Easily bootstrap a Phaser 3 project with an Express backend and great developer tools.

## ‚úèÔ∏è **Languages**

-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## üß∞ **Tools**

-   [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/)
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### üöß **Prerequisites**

Install [Node.js/npm](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/).

### üèóÔ∏è **Setup**

1. **Acquire Template**

Clone or press the "Use Template" button.

2. **Install Dependencies**

If using VSCode, run the "Install Dependencies" task using the Quick Open shortcut. The Keyboard Shortcut for Quick Open on your system can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings). Or run `npm install` in the root directory within terminal.

3. **Develop!**

Now you can start creating your app! Check out the comments on the individual files within `client/src/scenes/internal/` to learn more about the Phaser setup, or use your own Phaser setup. I also recommend testing if your install went well with the "Dev" task in the Run and Debug tab if using VSCode, or by sending `npm run dev` in console.

### ‚û°Ô∏è **Next Steps**

If you are using VSCode, there are numerous tasks setup to make development easier.

-   **Populate Project Information**

Look for instances of "Example Project" or "example_project" within the files and replace them with your project's information.

-   **Generate Favicon**

You can automatically generate the site's Favicon for various platforms using a single .png file. Replace `icon.png` within `client/assets/site/icon/` with your desired icon. Then, run the "Generate Favicon" task similarly to step 2 in Setup. It will automatically generate the icons and place them within the same directory.

### üì¶ **Packages**

This template includes [RexRainbow's Phaser plugins](https://rexrainbow.github.io/phaser3-rex-notes/docs/site/plugin-list/), which are so good that they should be used in every Phaser 3 project.

It also includes [StoreJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/storejs), which is an api to handle localStorage- a way browsers can store data locally that persists between sessions. In this example it's used to remember the state of the debug mode (Left Shift key to toggle): enabled or not.

[WebFontLoader](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/webfont_loader) from Google is also included to easily implement fonts.
